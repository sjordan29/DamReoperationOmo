# Dam reoperation to mitigate changing climate extremes in the Omo river valley

## Overview
This repository contains the code used to calculate high and low flow extremes , perform analyses, and make figures in support of:

Jordan SM, Quinn JD, Zaniolo, M, Giuliani M, Castelletti A. 2023. Dam reoperation to mitigate changing climate extremes in the Omo river valley. In prep.

## Folder Structure
* `Python Scripts`: contains the code used to calculate extreme flows and make all figures for the paper.
* `Extremes`: contains high and low flow time series for all climate projections, reservoir control policies, and an uncontrolled scenario. 

## Additional Code
* [Advacing SWAT reservoir operations](https://github.com/sjordan29/advancing-SWAT-reservoir-ops/tree/main): contains all the code for the paper that supports this work (e.g., updating the SWAT reservoir module, reservoir optimization, running SWAT)
* [SWAT source code updates](https://github.com/sjordan29/SWAT-source-code-updates)
* [Climate projection downscaling & debiasing](https://github.com/sjordan29/omo-cmip-downscaling-debias)
